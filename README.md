# Data Projects

Each folder corresponds to a different project. Most are only gitlab mirrors or subrepresentations. 

Clicking on ipynb files should suffice for them to be rendered and allow for exploring without setting a jupyter environment and/or running any code.

Alternatively, [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/) can be used.
